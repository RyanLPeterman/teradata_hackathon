## General Implementation

	User interface - Fullscreen map of city with heat map of statistics overlayed to help user choose housing
		- Provides user fields to enter their max price, lowest price, and number of bedrooms desired

	Front End - Uses Google Maps API to show the map of San Francisco with heatmap of crimes
		- Places to live that fit the user's query are set as markers

	Back End - Grabs Data from database based on the front end's search parameters (i.e. max/min price, num bedrooms)

## Future Ideas
	
	1. Add other datasets that the to-be buyer of a house would like to know about the surrounding area
		i.e. How the traffic is, how many schools are in the area

	2. Expand the ideas to more areas that just San Francisco
